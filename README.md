This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Live - https://designlab87.github.io/portfolio

### Features

- Clean React code
- Minimal Design
- Easy to customize

## Customization

Customizing the page is done by:
1. Enter your information into the `src/Constants.js`. You can see where each `const` is used by looking to `App.js`.
2. Create a directory called `Constants` under `src` and move the `Constants.js` file into it.
3. Create an `assets` directory under `public`, with the following subfolders: img, logos, resume.
4. Add your images.
5. Run `npm start`.

## NPM Infos

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
